The wild-type PDB was split into peptide.pdb and mhc.pdb, and the initial parameter files .rst and .prmtop were generated using the leap.in file. Each system folder contained the manually mutated peptide.pdb and the generated .rst and .prmtop files.
The mhc.pdb file leap.in file is identical for each structure.
